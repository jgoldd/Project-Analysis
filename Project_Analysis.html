	<div><h1>Site Intent</h1></div>
<div>
<p>Craigslist is one of the most used local classifieds and forums. One of Craigslist’s goals is to keep a community that’s free to all local posters. Allowing anyone to post in any city or states classifieds or forums. Craigslist makes it very simple for anyone to get on and post an ad for anything like, Jobs, Housing, and sale items. While I believe Craigslist have done a great job at keeping the site free and simple for anyone to use.; it doesn’t have great legibility from a User Centered Design. All the links are pushed together and displayed all at once. Giving a cluttered look to the site. From Usability stand point it works, but I feel it could work better by creating better visibility. From Hick’s Law, I’m going to reduce the clutter and give the user more satisfaction. <p>


<p>There are two main goals of a Craigslist user, to find something, or to get rid of something. Now with over 60 million users each month in the US alone I believe that users are finding the site to meet their goals.</p>

<p> I believe by adding a visually appealing user centered design to craigslist this will give the user a better over-all experience and increase the number of visitors dramatically. The design will use breadcrumbs and graphical buttons instead of underlined links to guide the user.</p>
